Manzona, Dan, Bakari, and I worked on a project together. The challenge was to have a golf ball dropped by 6 feet 
	and have it land in 12 straws. The materials we had for this task were 12 strawws, 18 inches of tape, a 
	scisscors. This task was very difficult to do considering we only had 12 straws and only 18 inches of tape. 
	
	The second challenge was to build the tallest skyscraper with about 5 pieces of news paper and 12 inches of paper. 
	Ours was between 53 and 58 inches tall.
	
	With this project I helped with the planning and building of the project. I helped build the bottom part to the 
	12 straws. The last thing I helped with is the building of the skyscaper. I helped with the rolling of the papers and the taping of it.
