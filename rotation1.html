The Marble Maze Challenge was to build the longest structure to carry a marble into a selected square landing pad.  
My marble maze design team consisted of Madison Coleman, Nick Hulsey, and Jae Hwi.  
Our structure was mostly made of paper that started at the far edge of the table and ended about a third of the way across the table from the taped square.  
We designed the paper as a ramp that was stabilized with straws and a piece of string taped to the table.
Our idea was that once the marble was dropped onto the ramp it would gain enough speed to go straight across the  table and hit the two paper barriers that surrounded the square and land inside it.
After we were done designing, we tested it once with the marble and it landed exactly inside the square.  
When we tried again, this time with Mr. Gerber judging our structure, the marble swung too wide and missed the paper barrier and the taped square.
