During Rotation 3 we used the process of Garment, Sublimation, and UV printing. Sublimation is the process at which ink goes from a liquid right to a solid by the transfer of heat. During this process I got a blank mouse pad and then printed my picture of my dad. I then taped the picture of my dad to the mouse pad and turned the heat compressor thing on so it would reach to 400 degrees/ I then put the mouse pad and picture of my dad on the head compressor and it transferred to the blank mouse pad. 
For the tshirt, you have to make something relating to ohio, hudson, or reserve. I then made my design on GTX and then saved the file to a flash drive and put the flash drive in the machine. You first had to heat the first to make it flat and then you have to put the t shirt on the machine and let it print. Finally, after its printed you have to put it back on the iron/heat compressor and then your done. 
	Finally, the UV printer. I made a puzzle. I took the template of the puzzle and put a picture of me and my grandparents on the template. I then had to line up the laser to the top edge of the puzzle and then press go.
